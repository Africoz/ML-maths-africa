 # Day 01 - Systems of Linear Equations (ML-Math Africo)

## What You Learn Today
- What are systems of linear equations?
- Real-life metaphors to understand them.
- How they apply to machine learning.
- Hands-on Python code to solve them.

## **Metaphor - The Restaurant Order Problem**

Imagine 3 friends order 3 meals (rice, chicken, drink). Each meal has a different price, but the waiter forgets individual prices. All they know is the **total bill for each person**.

| Person | Rice | Chicken | Drink | Total Bill |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | 1 | 1 | 1 | ₹150 |
| B | 2 | 1 | 0 | ₹200 |
| C | 0 | 1 | 2 | ₹170 |

This is a **system of equations**.

## **How This Connects to ML?**
- Linear Regression training often solves such systems.
- Many ML algorithms need to find "weights" that fit data — exactly solving a system.
- Deep learning also involves solving linear systems in matrix form.

## **Code Example - Solving with Python (Numpy)**

The notebook contains code that solves such systems using matrix operations.  
Open the notebook to try it in Google Colab.

## **Why This Matters?**
- Understanding these basic building blocks will make advanced ML math (like matrix factorization, regression, PCA) super easy.
- This is our first stepping stone in the 30-day ML Math Africo journey!

## **Next Day Teaser - Matrices**
Tomorrow we expand into matrices and how they power all of ML!
